# Day 5 - March 23, 2017

### What I did yesterday:
- built basic NLP model
- experimented with some part of speech tagging and brown clusters
- loaded some values for Y but had a lot of missing values
- partial completion on new data extraction for Y in Java through IB's API


### What I am working on today:
- complete the MVP with the following:
	- NLP model using spaCy with the following features in X:
		- basic sentiment
		- TFIDF
	- Complete 30 min timeseries data and use it as a proxy for the target variable
		- SHY as proxy for 1-3 yr treasury
		- SPY for general market
		- VXX for volatility
		- USD/YEN, USD/EUR for currency
- Gradient boosting tree-based method for prediction

### What are the current roadblocks:
- Older high frequency data.  Solution: look into IQ Feed
- D3.js I'm not yet familiar with the package
