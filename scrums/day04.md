# Day 4 - March 23, 2017

### What I did yesterday:
- learned to use spaCy
- delved deep into speech tagging and other feature extraction with NLP
- learned to gather stock timeseries data in Python

### What I am working on today:
- start building an NLP model using spaCy with the following features:
	- number of days
- gather daily time series data and use it as a proxy for the target variable
	- SHY as proxy for 1-3 yr treasury
	- SPY for general market
	- VXX for volatility
	- USD/YEN, USD/CAD, USD/CNH and USD/EUR for currency
	- ^FVX for 5yr, ^TYX for 30 yr, 
- try a tree-based method for prediction
- improve on project plan
- plan out the web app
- explore D3.js
- understanding sementic trees

### What are the current roadblocks:
- Older high frequency data.  Solution: look into IQ Feed
- D3.js I'm not yet familiar with the package
