# Day 2 - March 20, 2017

### What I did yesterday:
- created a project plan
- gathered all missing FOMC meeting minutes
- created a class for the automatic loading of all historical FOMC meeting statements

### What I am working on today:
- start building an NLP model using spaCy
- gather daily time series data and use it as a proxy for the target variable
- try a tree-based method for prediction
- improve on project plan
- plan out the web app
- explore D3.js
- explore NYTimes article pull and Factiva
- understanding sementic trees

### What are the current roadblocks:
- Older high frequency data.  Solution: look into IQ Feed
- D3.js I'm not yet familiar with the package
