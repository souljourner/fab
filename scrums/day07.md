# Day 7 - March 25, 2017

### What I did yesterday:
- Analyzed the y data and found there to be a lot of inconsistencies and misprints.  The data was gotten using "midpoint" between bid and ask.


### What I am working on today:
- download new trades data instead of midpoint.
- clean data of misprints and ensure accuracy
- create basic sentiment analysis
- complete the MVP with the following:
	- NLP model using spaCy with the following features in X:
		- basic sentiment
		- TFIDF
- Gradient boosting tree-based method for prediction

### What are the current roadblocks:
- D3.js I'm not yet familiar with the package
