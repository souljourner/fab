# Day 9 - March 29, 2017

### What I did yesterday:
- NLP model using sklearn with the following features in X:
		- TFIDF
- streamlined code from notebook to create a pipeline that runs and scores the model based on several different sk-learn models
- runs model on logistic regression, naive bays, and random forest (no tuning)
- got better than chance results but results vary greately depending on train/test slip

### What I am working on today:
- find a way to get the scoring more consistent
- engineer other price features into the X
- cross validating only on earlier data (timeseries cross validation in sklearn)
- turn scoring into a regression and not just classificiation and see if it improves the scoring
- dig further into ways to improve with NLP methods
- create basic sentiment analysis
- dig deeper on random forest model to see if it can increase the scores
- grid search
- gradient boosting tree-based method for prediction
- basic sentiment
- start looking at ways to do visualization


### What are the current roadblocks:
- D3.js I'm not yet familiar with the package
